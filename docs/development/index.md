# Development

EDS-NLP is in active development. If you use the library for a research project, you should consider pinning its version, or better yet, using a strict dependency manager like Poetry, which will dramatically enhance the reproducibility of your analysis.

If you find a bug, notice a sub-optimal implementation or think of a nice new feature, you can file an issue, and even better, propose a pull request that closes the latter!

We welcome contributions !
